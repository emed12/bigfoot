This map shows the locations of Bigfoot sightings in Washington state in comparison with sighting densities per county. According to an Axios article (https://www.axios.com/local/seattle/2023/04/26/bigfoot-washington-sightings), Bigfoot is more commonly sighted in Washington than any other state in the U.S. To illustrate this, I altered a dataset created by Timothy Renner (https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data) by combining information from Renner's locations and reports datasets. 

Also included in this map are color-coded icons representing the type of sighting reported. As described by the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (https://www.bfro.net/gdb/classify.asp#classification), Class A sightings involve clear visibility, Class B involve possible misidentification due to poor visibility, and Class C involve word-of-mouth reports.

For county boundaries I used this dataset (https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/12712f465fc44fb58328c6e0255ca27e/explore?location=47.066964%2C-120.817600%2C6.74) from the Washington Geospatial Open Data Portal.

The databases used in this map include: leaflet.css, leaflet.js, ajax.js chroma.js, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts. 

Users can pan, zoom, and click on pop-ups to view sighting class types. Further information about the number of sightings per county and types of sightings are included in the legend.
